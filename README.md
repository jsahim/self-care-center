# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
- I was able to build an app that allows you to select either a mantra or affirmation message type, then generate a randomly selected message to be displayed. The user can also delete the message of they do not like it and it will not be displayed again. This application solves the problem of finding inspiration which drives us to face the day with a positive attitude.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
1. Fork and Clone the following repository: https://github.com/jsahim/self-care-center
2. Type `cd self-care-center` to move into the root directory
3. Open the repository in your preferred text editor

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
- I am half way through Mod 1 and I was given 5 days to work on this project.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
  - I believe that I demonstrated a fair command of all 3 languages to create my application. 
- Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
  - This mod, I tried to match the comp exactly and I believe that I was mostly successful with this.
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
  - I think that I understood better practices for the event handling flow and reduced unnecessary duplication.
- Individualize your programming skill set
  - I still believe CSS is somewhat intuative for me. There is still much to perfect but I think this might give me an edge in the future.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
- Although I only did one CYOA feature, from my QA testing, there are no bugs that I can see and any possible combination of user actions will be met with the desired response.
- As a repeater, I initially felt that it was expected of me to do more than one CYOA feature, but while I contemplated those additions, I decide on perfecting the one that I had created. Ultimately, I think the singular feature provides a better user experience than several features with possibly buggy functionality. Learning this quality over quantity approach has been challenging for me.
